				<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
				<p>A lot of my free time also goes to studying the Bible and doing work for my local church. I love volunteering time to my local assembly and get the opportunity to learn a lot from it.
				When I have free time, I practice and play music. I also work with audio and have been learning to love music and sound in its many different applications. I have been lucky enough to grow up with both parents and am the oldest of four siblings. This 
				has taught me patience, displine, consistency and growing wisdom.
				I love to program and have been doing so since high school. I have loved messing around with technology a 
					lot earlier and climbing into a career into technology. I have worked with several languages such as Python, C++ and HTML, and am broadening my horizons daily to get better in my field.
				Never have I ever been the most athletically gifted kid growing up, but when I was old enough to, I started lifting and instantly fell in love. This love grew because of the progress I 
					was making and the sense of accomplishment that follows. Working out, eating right, and overall living a healthy lifestlye is one of the best discoveries I have made so far and I am excited to see how far I can go with it.Â
