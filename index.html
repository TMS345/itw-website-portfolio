			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src = "church.png" alt = "Church Image">
			<h3>Religion</h3>
			<p>A lot of my free time also goes to studying the Bible and doing work for my local church. I love volunteering time to my local assembly and get the opportunity to learn a lot from it.</p>
			
			<img src = "live-music.png" alt = "Music Image">		
			<h3>Music</h3>
			<p>When I have free time, I practice and play music. I also work with audio and have been learning to love music and sound in its many different applications.</p>
			
			<img src = "big-family.png" alt = "Family Image">
			<h3>Family</h3>
			<p>​I have been lucky enough to grow up with both parents and am the oldest of four siblings. This has taught me patience, displine, consistency and growing wisdom.</p>
			
			<img src = "data-management.png" alt = "Tech Image">
			<h3>Tech</h3>
			<p>I love to program and have been doing so since high school. I have loved messing around with technology a 
				lot earlier and climbing into a career into technology. I have worked with several languages such as Python, C++ and HTML, and am broadening my horizons daily to get better in my field.
				</p>
			
			<img src = "healthy-heart.png" alt = "Healthy Living Image">
			<h3>Healthy Living</h3>
			<p>Never have I ever been the most athletically gifted kid growing up, but when I was old enough to, I started lifting and instantly fell in love. This love grew because of the progress I 
				was making and the sense of accomplishment that follows. Working out, eating right, and overall living a healthy lifestlye is one of the best discoveries I have made so far and I am excited to see how far I can go with it.
